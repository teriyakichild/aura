## Overview
AURA is a TOML-based configuration system for composing Rig.rs AI agents with MCP tools and RAG pipelines.

## Current Status: Production Ready

All major features complete:
- Bounded streaming with custom aura events
- Rig 0.28 upgrade with ProviderAgent architecture
- Configurable MCP header forwarding (`headers_from_request` with static TOML fallback)
- Request-scoped MCP progress and cancellation
- Client disconnect detection with MCP `notifications/cancelled`
- Multi-agent orchestration mode with coordinator/worker architecture and DAG execution

**Pending**: Upstream Rig PRs - StreamingPromptHook fix + Content-Type header fix

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release

# Start web server (default config.toml)
cargo run --bin aura -- webserver

# Start with orchestration config
CONFIG_PATH=configs/example-math-orchestration.toml AURA_CUSTOM_EVENTS=true cargo run --bin aura -- webserver

# Build and run CLI (HTTP mode — connects to a running `aura webserver`)
cargo run -p aura-cli -- --api-url http://localhost:8080

# Build and run CLI (standalone mode — no server needed, default when --api-url absent)
cargo run -p aura-cli -- --config configs/my-agent.toml

# Run integration tests (local, requires Docker)
make test-integration-local                        # base integration
make test-integration-orchestration-local          # orchestration integration
make test-integration-sre-orchestration-local      # SRE orchestration integration
```

## Key Features

### Configuration System
- TOML-based declarative configuration
- Environment variable resolution (`{{ env.VAR }}`)
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Gemini, Ollama, OpenRouter)
- Dynamic tool registration

### MCP Integration
- **HTTP Transport**: Full authentication and tool execution
- **SSE Transport**: AWS Knowledge Base integration
- **STDIO Transport**: Tool discovery
- **Header Forwarding**: `headers_from_request` mappings with static TOML `headers` as fallback
- **Cancellation**: `notifications/cancelled` propagation on client disconnect
- **Status reporting**: per-server connection state (`Connected`/`Failed(reason)`/`NotAttempted`) is tracked in `McpManager::server_info` and projected to clients via the `aura.mcp_status` SSE event. Transport/auth failures bubble as errors.

### Streaming
- OpenAI-compatible SSE streaming (`/v1/chat/completions`)
- Custom `aura.*` events (opt-in via `AURA_CUSTOM_EVENTS=true`):
  - `aura.session_info`, `aura.mcp_status`, `aura.tool_requested`, `aura.tool_start`, `aura.tool_complete`, `aura.reasoning`, `aura.progress`, `aura.worker_phase`, `aura.tool_usage`, `aura.usage`, `aura.context_usage`, `aura.scratchpad_usage`
  - `aura.usage` reports **cumulative provider-billed** tokens (Σ input + Σ output across every LLM turn), identical in single-agent and orchestration mode. `aura.context_usage` reports **context-window occupancy** — the provider's final-turn input/output (`context_tokens`/`response_tokens`) plus optional `context_window` — per-agent (single-agent emits one; orchestration emits one per worker plus one `main` reading for the conversation, taken from the first LLM turn of the request's first planning call — later inner turns and planning cycles carry the coordinator's scratch conversation and report nothing). Both derive from provider usage, not a local tokenizer. See `crates/aura/src/streaming_request_hook.rs` (`UsageState`) for the billed-vs-occupancy split
- Image input: a user message's `content` may be the OpenAI content-part array; `image_url` parts (base64 `data:` URLs only; remote URLs are refused because Bedrock rejects and Ollama drops them) become rig image parts so vision models see the picture. In orchestration mode only the coordinator sees them, on the request's first planning call (the turn stays in its conversation for later cycles); workers get text tasks. Conversion lives in `convert_content_part` (`crates/aura-web-server/src/handlers.rs`); `aura::message_text` is the text-only projection used for scratchpad seeding and the orchestration goal; `aura::message_for_trace` is the OTel input projection, which keeps the text and replaces each image with a `[image <mime> base64 <n> bytes detail=<level>]` marker. The request body cap is `--max-request-body-bytes` / `MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES` (default 20 MiB), applied as an axum `DefaultBodyLimit` in `server.rs`
- Request cancellation on timeout or client disconnect
- Two-phase graceful shutdown: new requests rejected immediately (503), in-flight streams get configurable grace period (`SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECS`, default 30s)

### Scratchpad (Context Window Management)
- Intercepts large MCP tool outputs and saves them to disk instead of filling the context window; works in both single-agent and orchestration mode. Full usage/config docs: https://docs.mezmo.com/aura/scratchpad
- Code pointers: token-counter dispatch lives in `token_counter_for_provider` (`scratchpad/context_budget.rs`); per-agent budgets live on `Agent.scratchpad_budget`, created at `create_worker()` time; read tools resolve files under a per-agent **read root** distinct from the write-confined scratchpad dir (`ScratchpadStorage::with_read_root`)

### Orchestration (Multi-Agent)
- Coordinator/worker architecture with DAG-based parallel task execution
- Per-worker LLM overrides: workers inherit `[agent.llm]` by default; `[orchestration.worker.<name>.llm]` overrides it (different model, same provider config). Resolved inline at worker construction (`worker.llm.as_ref().unwrap_or(&agent.llm)`)
- Dependency-aware multi-wave execution with iterative re-planning (`max_planning_cycles`)
- Three-way routing: direct answer, orchestrated plan, clarification
- `aura.orchestrator.*` SSE events for real-time visibility (see https://docs.mezmo.com/aura/streaming-api-guide)

### Unified Binary
- `aura` is the only shipped executable: interactive client by default, web server behind `aura webserver`
- `webserver` is a clap subcommand whose trailing args go straight to `aura_web_server::server::{parse_args, serve}`, which then owns the process
- `aura-web-server` is a deprecated shim that delegates to `server::serve`. To retire it: drop the `[[bin]]`, `tests/deprecation_shim.rs`, the dist artifacts in `.makefiles/rust.mk`, the nfpm entry in `scripts/build-packages.sh`, and the Dockerfile release copy

### CLI (`aura-cli`)
- Interactive terminal client with REPL, one-shot mode, and conversation persistence
- **One-shot output contract** (`--query`): stdout is the **raw assistant response only** — no `●` markers, no markdown rendering, no tool-execution summaries, no response-summary header, no `backend.summarize` round-trip. Errors, permission prompts, and warnings go to stderr (with `error:` / `warning:` prefixes, no markers). Exit code 0 ⇒ stdout is the full response; non-zero ⇒ stderr explains and stdout is empty. The REPL retains rich formatting; the strict-output rules apply only to `--query` mode. See `crates/aura-cli/src/oneshot.rs`.
- **Two backends:** standalone mode (default when `--api-url` absent) and HTTP mode (`--api-url`)
- **Agent-config discovery** (standalone): `--config`/`AURA_CONFIG` → `./config.toml` → `~/.aura/agents/` → `~/.aura/agent.toml`. **First hit wins outright — locations are never merged**, so a local `config.toml` shadows the global agents completely (they are absent from `/model`; reach them with `--config ~/.aura/agents/`). No walk-up through parent directories, and `~/.aura/config.toml` is excluded (it is the legacy CLI-preferences name). Lives in `crates/aura-cli/src/agent_config.rs`; `aura init` offers to install into `~/.aura/agents/` (`--global`), prompting for the agent name that becomes both the filename and `[agent].name`
- Standalone mode is enabled by the `standalone-cli` default feature; `--standalone` flag overrides `AURA_API_URL` env var but is mutually exclusive with the `--api-url` flag. HTTP-only builds: `--no-default-features`
- `--model` works in both modes: HTTP passes it as starting model; standalone matches against agent.name/agent.alias in configs
- `--system-prompt` works in both modes: standalone prompts for append/replace; HTTP prompts for AURA vs OpenAI-compatible service
- `--force` bypasses non-critical warnings (e.g. HTTP system-prompt in query mode)
- Local tool execution: Shell, Read, ListFiles, Update, SearchFiles, FindFiles, FileInfo
- **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.** CLI advertises local tools to the server with `--enable-client-tools`; the server attaches them only when `[agent].enable_client_tools = true` (filtered by `client_tool_filter` globs). Both sides must opt in; single-agent configs only. Functionally equivalent to handing the LLM a shell prompt on the client machine. Full risk model and protocol details: https://docs.mezmo.com/aura/client-side-tools
- Permission system (`.aura/permissions.json`, formerly `settings.json`) with allow/deny glob rules. Discovered by walking up from `$PWD` to find the closest `.aura/`. **Project-scoped only** — no global `~/.aura/permissions.json`. Legacy `settings.json` is still read with a deprecation warning; new rules saved at the prompt land in `permissions.json` and migrate any existing legacy rules forward.
- CLI preferences live in `~/.aura/cli.toml` (global) and `<project>/.aura/cli.toml` (per-project override, walk-up discovered, merged on top of global per-field). Renamed from `~/.aura/config.toml` to avoid collision with AURA **agent** TOML configs; the old name is still read with a deprecation warning.
- **Status line** under the input frame: `[status_line] segments = [...]` in `cli.toml` picks and orders `model`, `server`, `cwd`, `git`, `context`, `tokens`, `scratchpad`, `mcp` (all shown by default). Rendered locally from `ui::status_line` — no extra requests or tokens. Standalone mode shows `cwd`/`git`; HTTP mode shows `server` (the `--api-url` host) instead, keeping `cwd` only with `--enable-client-tools` (`AgentHost` in `ui::status_bar`). `context` shows the token count, or a meter/percentage when the agent's `[agent.llm].context_window` is set. In an orchestrated conversation it shows the conversation's context from the `main` `aura.context_usage` reading (the request's first planning call); mid-turn `aura.tool_usage` estimates are ignored there because they mix in worker turns.
- `/model` command works in both modes — lists server models (HTTP) or loaded TOML configs (standalone)
- Env vars: `AURA_API_URL`, `AURA_API_KEY`, `AURA_MODEL`, `AURA_EXTRA_HEADERS`, `AURA_LOG_FILE`
- **Diagnostic logs**: opt-in via `--log-file <path>` / `AURA_LOG_FILE` / `cli.toml` `log_file` (precedence: CLI > env > project > global > none). Events are appended to the file (no rotation — user-managed) in **both REPL and one-shot mode**, so stdout stays a clean pipe. Default filter is `warn,aura=info,aura_cli=info,aura_config=info,rig::agent::prompt_request=info`; override with `RUST_LOG`.
- **OpenTelemetry (standalone only)**: when running in standalone mode, the CLI installs an OTel layer when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set. Trace shape mirrors the web server — `agent.stream` root span via `direct.rs`, with `agent.turn` / `mcp.tool_call` / `orchestration.*` nesting under it. CLI omits the HTTP-infrastructure spans (`chat_completions`, `streaming_completion`) since it has no HTTP layer.
- **Single shared tokio runtime**: `main` owns one `tokio::runtime::Runtime` and threads it into `Backend::from_config`, `run_oneshot`, and `run_repl`. `logging::init` runs inside `rt.enter()` so the OTLP gRPC exporter can call `Handle::current()` during `with_tonic()` construction; the `BatchSpanProcessor` worker lives on the same runtime that handles every subsequent request. `main` calls `aura::logging::shutdown_tracer()` via `rt.block_on(...)` before returning to flush buffered spans.
- SSE event parsing uses shared types from the `aura-events` crate
- See `crates/aura-cli/README.md` for full documentation

### Shared Event Types (`aura-events`)
- Lightweight crate defining `AuraStreamEvent` and `OrchestrationStreamEvent` enums
- Both `Serialize + Deserialize` — used by the web server (producer) and CLI (consumer)
- No agent, MCP, or provider dependencies — only `serde` and `serde_json`
- `ProgressToken` type uses a local wire-compatible definition by default; enables `rmcp-types` feature for direct rmcp interop (used by the `aura` crate)

## Environment Setup

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"  # Optional
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key" # Optional
export MEZMO_API_KEY="your-key"       # For Mezmo MCP
export AWS_PROFILE="your-profile"     # For Knowledge Base
export AWS_REGION="your-region"       # For Knowledge Base
```

## Architecture

### Dependencies
- **rig-core 0.28**: ProviderAgent architecture (via fork for StreamingPromptHook fix)
- **rmcp 0.12**: MCP client with cancellation support
- **Rig Fork**: `mezmo/rig` branch `mshearer/LOG-23351-openai-reasoning`

### Key Modules
- `provider_agent.rs` - Type-erased streaming across providers
- `stream_events.rs` - Custom aura SSE events
- `request_cancellation.rs` - Request lifecycle management
- `tool_event_broker.rs` - FIFO queue for tool_call_id correlation (see critical assumption below)
- `orchestration/` - Multi-agent coordinator, workers, DAG execution, orchestration SSE events

### Critical Assumption: Rig Sequential Tool Execution

The `tool_event_broker` uses a FIFO queue for correlating `tool_call_id` between hook and MCP execution contexts. **This relies on Rig 0.28 streaming mode executing tools sequentially.**

**If upgrading Rig**, verify this assumption by reviewing:
- `rig-core/src/agent/prompt_request/streaming.rs`
- Look for `.await` between `on_tool_call` and `on_tool_result` (ensures sequential)
- Check for `FuturesUnordered` or parallel execution patterns (would break FIFO)

Confirmed sequential as of Rig 0.28: the streaming handler `.await`s each tool call inline. See `docs/rig-fork-changes.md`.

## CI/CD

**Status**: Jenkins/Makefile complete, Helm charts and K8s manifests in `deployment/`

```bash
make build                  # Build release binary
cargo test --workspace      # Run all tests (the `make test` hook is empty)
make docker-build           # Build Docker image
make lint                   # Run clippy + fmt check (fmt uses cargo +nightly)
make ci                     # Bundle: fmt-check + lint (test hook is empty)
```

**Before committing, run `cargo +nightly fmt --check`, `cargo clippy
--workspace`, and `cargo test --workspace`.** After committing, run
`make lint-commits` to verify the commit message. fmt runs under
`cargo +nightly` (see `.makefiles/rust.mk`), so use `cargo +nightly fmt
--check` — not `cargo fmt` — to match CI. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the
full workflow.

### Release channels

One branch per channel: `nightly` (development, `X.Y.Z-nightly.N`), a
per-cycle `beta` (`X.Y.Z-beta.N`), and `main` (stable `X.Y.Z`, what
`latest`/Homebrew/the package repo follow). **Branch from and target
`nightly`**, not `main`. See `docs/design/release-channels.md`.

## Code Comment Conventions

- **Document behavior where it lives, not on data.** A comment describing *what
  happens* (how a value is produced, consumed, derived, or interpreted) belongs
  on the function/branch that implements it — not on a struct, field, enum
  variant, or other type definition. Type-level comments state only *what the
  value is* (its meaning/unit), never cross-referenced runtime behavior.
  - **The drift test — apply it to every type-level comment:** if the comment
    would have to change when code in *a different function* changes, it is in
    the wrong place. Move it to that function.
  - **Red-flag words on a type definition.** These almost always signal behavior
    narration that belongs elsewhere: "when", "if", "unless", "for … that",
    "absent/`None`/empty when", "set/populated when", "becomes", "used by",
    "consumed by", "so that", "which lets", "approximates", "exceeds",
    "falls back". Seeing one on a struct/field/enum is a prompt to move it.
  - **`Option`, enums, and defaults describe their own shape — don't narrate it.**
    The `Option` already says the value can be absent; the enum already lists its
    variants. Do *not* document *when* each state occurs (`None when …`,
    `Empty for …`) on the type — that condition lives at the code that sets it.
  - Bad (on a struct field): `execution_ms - tool_ms approximates LLM-thinking
    time`; `None for direct answers and runs that failed before any iteration`;
    `becomes the next iteration's planning_ms`. Each describes behavior owned by
    a consumer or a write site.
  - Good (on the field): `Plan ready → continuation-prompt entrypoint.` The
    derivation/interpretation lives at the code that computes or displays it.
- **Don't describe the same behavior in more than one place.** Pick the single
  site that implements it; from elsewhere, reference — don't restate. Duplicated
  prose drifts out of sync. If you find yourself writing something already
  documented at the implementing site, delete it rather than restating it.
- **Comment on current behavior, not change history.** Describe what the code
  does now, as if it were always this way — git records the diff, the comment
  should not. Do not phrase a comment relative to the past: avoid "prior we did
  XYZ, now we ABC", "(unchanged)", "legacy behavior", "now does X",
  "previously…", "still works as before", "moved from…", "keep current
  behavior". History-relative phrasing drifts out of sync as the code evolves
  and is noise to anyone who didn't witness the change — rewrite it as a
  present-tense statement of what the code does.
- **Before finishing any code change, run the drift test on every comment you
  added or touched that sits on a struct, field, enum, or variant.** For each,
  ask "would this change if a different function changed?" — if yes, move (don't
  copy) it onto the implementing code. Check the whole comment, not just its
  first clause: the anti-pattern often hides as a trailing "; …when…" or "; …
  becomes…" appended to an otherwise-correct definition.

## Commit and Contribution Rules

- **No AI co-authorship**: Never add `Co-Authored-By` lines for Claude or any AI assistant. Claude cannot accept the CLA.
- **Sign-off commits as the user**: Always sign off commits as the human user, not as Claude.
- **Commit message format**: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). First line must be entirely lowercase, no trailing period, under 72 characters. Use the body to explain **what** and **why**.
  Format: `<type>(<optional scope>): <description>`
  Types: `feat`, `fix`, `doc`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`
  Breaking changes: add `!` after type/scope and include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
  If fixing an issue, include `Fixes: #<issue number>` in the footer.
  If the change relates to a tracked ticket, include `Ref: LOG-XXXXXX` in the footer; otherwise omit it (commitlint does not require it).

## Documentation

All user-facing documentation (quickstarts, configuration reference, feature guides, CLI reference, web server reference) lives externally at **https://docs.mezmo.com/aura** (repo: `mezmo/documentation`, content under `aura/`) — not in this repo. This repo's own docs are developer/contributor-facing only:

- `README.md` - User-facing only: what AURA is, quick start, and pointers to `DEVELOPMENT.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md`/the hosted docs. No table of contents (GitHub generates one). No usage/configuration content, build-from-source, testing, architecture, or contributor content — those live at https://docs.mezmo.com/aura, in `DEVELOPMENT.md`, or in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Developer-facing: prerequisites, building from source, project structure, Make targets, testing (unit + integration suites and feature flags), and the architecture overview.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution process only: CLA, workflow, code quality standards, commit conventions, PR and review process. Build/test details belong in `DEVELOPMENT.md`; link, don't duplicate.
- `docs/` - Architecture/rationale only, not usage guides: `docs/rig-fork-changes.md` (Rig fork changes and rationale). ADRs in `docs/adr/`, design docs in `docs/design/`.
- `crates/*/README.md` - Crate-specific build/test instructions only (e.g. `crates/aura-cli/README.md` covers building and testing the CLI; its usage docs are on the hosted site).
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Auto-generated version history; never edit by hand

When adding or changing a user-facing feature, update the corresponding page in the `mezmo/documentation` repo (`aura/` directory) — this repo's `docs/` folder is not the place for it.
