# AURA CLI

A fast, interactive terminal client for chat completions with tool execution. Built primarily as the command line interface for [AURA by Mezmo](https://mezmo.com/aura), but works with **any OpenAI-compatible API** — plug in your own models, agents, or LLM endpoints.

---

## Quick Start

### Build from the mono-repo

```bash
# Default build (standalone + HTTP — builds agents in-process from TOML config)
cargo build -p aura-cli --release

# HTTP-only mode (lightweight, no agent/MCP dependencies)
cargo build -p aura-cli --release --no-default-features
```

The binary will be at `target/release/aura`.

### Run it

`aura` is AURA's only executable. It runs the interactive client by default and
the web server behind `webserver` (see `aura webserver --help`):

```bash
aura webserver --config config.toml --port 8080
```

#### HTTP mode (connect to a running `aura webserver`)

```bash
# Using environment variables
export AURA_API_URL="https://api.example.com"
export AURA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
aura

# Or pass flags directly
aura --api-url "https://api.example.com" \
         --api-key "your-api-key"
```

#### Standalone mode (no server needed)

Standalone mode is enabled by default. The CLI loads agent configs directly and runs without an HTTP server. When `--api-url` is not set, standalone mode activates automatically:

```bash
# Discovers a config (see the search order below)
aura

# Single TOML config file
aura --config path/to/agent.toml

# Directory of TOML configs (enables /model switching between agents)
aura --config configs/

# One-shot query in standalone mode
aura --config agent.toml --query "hello"

# Select a specific agent from a config directory
aura --config configs/ --model "Math Agent"
```

##### Config discovery

With no `--config`, the CLI searches these locations and uses the first hit:

| # | Location | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | `--config <path>` / `AURA_CONFIG` | File or directory, used verbatim. A path that doesn't exist is an error — it never falls through. |
| 2 | `./config.toml` | Current working directory only; parent directories are **not** searched. |
| 3 | `~/.aura/agents/` | Every `*.toml` in it loads at once, so `/model` switches between globally installed agents. Skipped if it holds no `.toml`. |
| 4 | `~/.aura/agent.toml` | Single global config. |

`~/.aura/config.toml` is deliberately *not* searched — that name belongs to the pre-rename CLI preferences file (see [Configuration File](#configuration-file)).

A `.env` beside the resolved config (or inside the resolved directory) is loaded too, so a global config can carry its own keys.

**One location wins outright — the search does not merge.** Whichever entry matches first supplies *every* agent; later entries are not consulted at all:

| Working directory has | Loaded | `/model` lists |
|---|---|---|
| `./config.toml` | `./config.toml` only | the local agent(s) only |
| nothing, and `~/.aura/agents/` has configs | every `*.toml` in `~/.aura/agents/` | all global agents |
| nothing anywhere | — | startup error listing each location tried |

So a local `config.toml` **shadows your global agents entirely** — they are not loaded, do not appear in `/model`, and Tab will not complete them. To reach them from such a directory, name the global set explicitly:

```bash
aura --config ~/.aura/agents/     # loads the global agents instead of the local config
```

Note that `--model <global-agent>` does *not* fall back to the global set; with a single-file local config an unmatched `--model` is currently ignored without an error.

In standalone mode, the CLI builds agents in-process using the same code paths as `aura-web-server`. MCP tools from the TOML config are available. CLI local tools (Shell, Read, Update, ...) become available when **both** sides opt in — pass `--enable-client-tools` and set `[agent].enable_client_tools = true` in the loaded TOML config (single-agent configs only; orchestrated configs drop client tools). See [Client-Side Tools](#client-side-tools) for details. The `/model` command works identically — it lists all loaded configs and lets you switch between them.

---

## Generating a starter config (`aura init`)

New to AURA? `aura init` walks you through creating a ready-to-run `config.toml` — no hand-editing TOML required.

```bash
aura init                 # interactive; asks where the config should live
aura init --global        # install to ~/.aura/agents/<name>.toml, no prompt
aura init -o my.toml      # choose the output path
```

It will:

- **Ask where the config should live**: `./config.toml` (this directory only) or `~/.aura/agents/<name>.toml`, which `aura` finds from any directory. Choosing global also asks for the agent name, which becomes both the filename and `[agent].name` — so a second global install lands beside the first instead of colliding with it. `--output` and `--global` answer the location up front (`--global` uses `--name`, default `assistant`); a non-interactive run always writes `./config.toml`, so scripted `aura init` never depends on your home directory.
- **Sense** your environment for a provider API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, …) and suggest that provider.
- **Pick a provider** from a validated list (openai, anthropic, bedrock, gemini, ollama, openrouter).
- **Handle the API key**: if the provider's conventional env var is already set it asks whether to use it; otherwise it prompts for the key (input is masked). The generated config references the key by its native env var (`api_key = "{{ env.OPENAI_API_KEY }}"`) — secrets are never written into `config.toml`.
- **Verify & list models**: it queries the provider's live model list and shows a short, curated shortlist (newest per family — pick by number, accept the default, or type any id). For Ollama it lists whatever you have installed.
- **Write** `config.toml`, plus a `.env` **only when you enter a new key** that isn't already in your environment. The `.env` holds a secret — add it to your `.gitignore`.

Both the web server and the standalone CLI load `.env` automatically at startup, so a config generated here runs as-is.

#### One `.env` per directory, not per agent

The `.env` is written **beside** the config. At startup the CLI loads up to two: the working directory's `.env` first, then the one beside whichever config was resolved. Loading never overwrites, so on any variable both define the working directory wins, and a shell `export` beats both. Agents installed side by side share the `.env` in their directory, which matters most in `~/.aura/agents/`:

```
~/.aura/agents/
├── .env              ← shared by every agent below
├── assistant.toml    ← api_key = "{{ env.OPENAI_API_KEY }}"
└── reviewer.toml     ← api_key = "{{ env.OPENAI_API_KEY }}"
```

Because a config references a key *by variable name*, two agents naming the same variable resolve to the same key. Installing the second with a different key replaces the value and re-points the first as well; `init` warns when it is about to do that. To give an agent its own credential, give it its own variable:

```bash
aura init --global --name work --api-key-env OPENAI_API_KEY_WORK
```

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-o, --output <PATH>` | Output config path. Omit to be asked local vs. global (`config.toml` when non-interactive). |
| `--global` | Install to `~/.aura/agents/<name>.toml` instead of asking. Conflicts with `--output`. |
| `--provider <P>` | Provider: openai, anthropic, bedrock, gemini, ollama, openrouter. |
| `--model <ID>` | Model id (skips the model picker). |
| `--api-key-env <VAR>` | Env var to read the key from (default per provider). |
| `--region <R>` | AWS region (bedrock only). |
| `--base-url <URL>` | Base URL (ollama only; default `http://localhost:11434`). |
| `--name <NAME>` | Agent name written to the config (default `assistant`). |
| `--offline` | Skip live model-list verification. |
| `--non-interactive` | Fail on missing values instead of prompting (automatic when stdin isn't a TTY). |
| `--force` | Overwrite an existing config without asking. |

For scripted/CI use, supply the required values as flags:

```bash
aura init --provider openai --model gpt-4o --non-interactive
```

---

## Backends

AURA CLI supports two backends, selected by the presence of `--api-url`:

| Backend                 | When                         | Dependencies                             | Tools                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Direct** (standalone, default) | No `--api-url` flag    | Full AURA stack (agents, MCP, providers) | MCP tools from TOML config; CLI local tools when `--enable-client-tools` is set  |
| **HTTP**                         | `--api-url <URL>`      | Lightweight — just HTTP client           | Server-side MCP tools always; CLI local tools when both sides opt in (see below) |

Both backends produce identical SSE event streams and share the same stream parser (`process_sse_events`), so all CLI features (stream panel, tool display, orchestration events, etc.) work identically regardless of backend.

### Feature flag: `standalone-cli`

The `standalone-cli` Cargo feature is **enabled by default**. It includes the full agent framework, MCP integration, and provider support. To build a lightweight HTTP-only client with no agent or MCP dependencies, disable default features:

```bash
# Default build — standalone + HTTP
cargo build -p aura-cli

# HTTP-only — small binary, fast compile, no agent dependencies
cargo build -p aura-cli --no-default-features
```

---

## Features

- **Interactive REPL** with conversation history, streaming responses, and markdown rendering
- **One-shot mode** for scripting and pipelines (`--query`) — stdout is the raw assistant response, no markers or markdown rendering
- **Local tool execution** — the model can read files, search code, list directories, run shell commands, and edit files on your behalf
- **Standalone mode** (default) — run agents directly from TOML config without a web server
- **Conversation persistence** — pick up where you left off with `--resume` or `/resume`
- **Tab completion** — cycle through slash commands, models, and conversations with `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`
- **Model selection** — browse and select models from the server (or loaded configs in standalone mode)
- **Permission system** — control which local tools are allowed, denied, or prompted before execution
- **SSE streaming** — real-time token-by-token output with a toggleable event panel
- **Auto-compaction** — automatic context management when conversations grow large
- **Mid-stream commands** — execute slash commands while the model is still streaming
- **Works with any OpenAI-compatible API** — not locked to a single provider

## Configuration File

The CLI looks for a TOML preferences file in two places, with the project file
overriding the global one on a per-field basis:

| File                              | Purpose                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.aura/cli.toml`                | Global defaults (across all projects)                    |
| `<project>/.aura/cli.toml`        | Project-local override, found by walking up from `$PWD`  |

The project lookup walks up from the current working directory until it finds a
`.aura/` directory (the same convention used by `.git`, `.editorconfig`, etc.).
Run the CLI from anywhere inside your project tree and the closest `.aura/cli.toml`
wins. `$HOME` is explicitly skipped so the global file is never picked up twice.

> **Renamed from `config.toml`.** Older versions read `~/.aura/config.toml`. The
> file is still read with a one-time deprecation warning — rename it to `cli.toml`
> at your convenience. The old name collided with AURA **agent** config TOMLs and
> will stop being read in a future release.

```toml
# ~/.aura/cli.toml or <project>/.aura/cli.toml
api_url = "https://api.example.com"
api_key = "your-api-key"
model = "gpt-4o"
system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant."
enable_client_tools = true   # opt in to local tool execution; default is false
log_file = "/tmp/aura.log"  # append-only; see Logging section below

[status_line]
# Segments shown under the input box, in display order. Omit the block for
# the default set; use an empty list to hide the line's segments entirely.
segments = ["model", "server", "cwd", "git", "context", "tokens", "scratchpad", "mcp"]
```

The status line is rendered locally from state the CLI already holds — no
extra requests or tokens. Segments: `model` (selected model, or the one the
server reports), `server` (the `--api-url` host in HTTP mode, without scheme
or credentials), `cwd` (`~`-abbreviated working directory), `git` (branch
from `.git/HEAD`, no `git` subprocess), `context` (tokens currently in the
model's context; becomes a meter with a percentage when the agent's
`[agent.llm]` config sets `context_window`, e.g. `context_window = 200000`;
hidden in orchestrated conversations, which span many agent contexts), `tokens` (cumulative prompt/completion as `in`/`out`), `scratchpad`
(`in` = tokens diverted into the scratchpad, `out` = tokens read back into
context; shown once any were intercepted), and `mcp` (connected/configured MCP servers). Segments with
nothing to show are omitted; on narrow terminals the cwd is shortened
first, then trailing segments are dropped. Which of `server`, `cwd`, and
`git` appear depends on the mode: standalone mode shows `cwd` and `git`;
HTTP mode shows `server` instead, since the agent's working tree is the
server's, keeping `cwd` only when `--enable-client-tools` runs local tools
against it.

> **Note on system prompts:** In **HTTP mode**, `--system-prompt` is intended for
> OpenAI-compatible backends that support system messages. **AURA's server ignores system
> role messages** — the CLI will prompt you to confirm whether you're connecting to AURA
> or another service. In **standalone mode**, `--system-prompt` can append to or replace
> the agent's TOML-configured system prompt (you'll be asked which). In one-shot mode
> (`--query`), standalone silently appends; HTTP mode requires `--force`.

> **Don't commit secrets.** A project `cli.toml` checked into source control will
> share `api_key` with everyone who clones the repo. Keep secrets in
> `~/.aura/cli.toml`, in `AURA_API_KEY`, or pass them with `--api-key`.

Any value set here is overridden by environment variables or CLI flags.

## One-Shot Mode

`--query <text>` runs a single round of the conversation and exits. The
output contract is strict: **stdout contains only the raw assistant
response** — exactly what the model produced, with no bullet markers, no
themed headers, no tool-execution summaries, no markdown rendering, and no
trailing response-summary line.

Anything that isn't the response goes to **stderr**:

- Diagnostic logs from `--log-file` / `AURA_LOG_FILE` (file destination
  unchanged; the file is the same destination in REPL and one-shot mode)
- Permission prompts for local tools (interactive, on TTY)
- Errors and warnings (with `error:` / `warning:` prefixes, no markers)
- The "no result for server tool X — set `AURA_CUSTOM_EVENTS=true`" hint

This means typical pipe usage works without scrubbing:

```bash
aura --query "summarize the README" > summary.md
aura --query "list three ideas as JSON" | jq .
aura --query "what's the version?" 2>/dev/null | tee log.txt
aura --query "what is in this frame?" --image frame.jpg
```

`--image <path>` attaches a local image to the query as an OpenAI
`image_url` content part (base64 `data:` URL) so a vision-capable agent
sees the picture. Repeat the flag for several images. A missing or
unsupported file is an error before any request is sent.

Exit code follows the standard contract: `0` ⇒ stdout is the complete
response; non-zero ⇒ stderr explains why and stdout is empty.

The REPL retains its rich formatting (bullet markers, markdown rendering,
tool-call summaries, animated headers). The strict-output rules above
apply only to `--query` mode.

---

## Interactive Commands

Once inside the REPL, the slash commands below are available. All slash commands can be executed while output is streaming.

| Command            | Description                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/help`            | Show available commands and keyboard shortcuts                      |
| `/clear`           | Start a new conversation (saves the current one first)              |

## Model Selection

Use `/model` to browse and select which model to use for requests.

```
/model              # list all available models
/model gpt          # filter models matching "gpt"
/model gpt-4o       # select "gpt-4o" if it matches exactly or uniquely
```

In **HTTP mode**, the model list is fetched from the server's `/v1/models` endpoint. In **standalone mode**, it comes directly from the loaded TOML configs (each config's `alias` or `name` becomes a selectable model).

---

## Client-Side Tools

> ---
> # **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**
> ---
>
> **Enabling client-side tools gives an LLM the ability to execute commands on your machine.** That includes running shell commands, reading and modifying files, and searching your filesystem — with the same privileges as the user running `aura`. Treat `--enable-client-tools` as functionally equivalent to handing the model a shell prompt.
>
> **The risks are real:**
> - **Prompt injection.** Anything the model reads — a file, a tool output, an MCP response, a webpage retrieved by another tool — can contain instructions that hijack the model into running destructive commands (`rm -rf`, exfiltrating secrets, modifying source code, etc.).
> - **Hallucination.** The model can confidently call the wrong tool with the wrong arguments. There is no undo for a `Shell("rm ...")` call.
> - **No sandbox.** Tools run directly on the host. There is no container, no chroot, no syscall filter. If you can run it from your shell, the model can run it through the CLI.
> - **The permission system reduces blast radius but is not a security boundary.** Globs are easy to over-grant (`Shell(*)` allows anything). Treat allow-rules conservatively and prefer prompt-on-execute for anything sensitive.
>
> **Only enable when:**
> - You trust the model and provider.
> - You trust every input the model can read (configs, MCP servers, vector stores, URLs).
> - You are running in a workspace where worst-case loss (deleted files, leaked credentials, modified source) is acceptable or recoverable from version control / backups.
>
> Disabled by default. Opting in is your decision and your responsibility.

By default, AURA CLI is a **pure chat client** — no local tools are advertised to the model and the REPL never executes anything on the host. Pass `--enable-client-tools` (or set `AURA_ENABLE_CLIENT_TOOLS=true`) to opt in to local tool execution, at which point the model can call tools like `Shell`, `Read`, and `Update` and the REPL runs them locally with permission checks.

```bash
# Disabled (default) — chat only
aura

# Enabled — local tools available, gated by the permission system
aura --enable-client-tools
AURA_ENABLE_CLIENT_TOOLS=true aura

# Explicitly disable (overrides config file)
aura --enable-client-tools=false
```

### How it works

When enabled, the CLI sends a `tools` field on every request describing the local tools (Shell, Read, Update, ListFiles, FindFiles, SearchFiles, FileInfo). The server registers them as **passthrough** tools — the LLM sees them as callable, but instead of executing server-side, the stream terminates with `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`. The CLI then executes the tool locally (after permission checks), appends the result to the conversation as a `role: "tool"` message, and submits a follow-up request. This keeps the permission system, Update grouping, and other interactive UX firmly in the REPL.

### Backend symmetry

> **Single-agent configurations only.** Client-side tools are not supported when the selected config has `[orchestration].enabled = true`. Tools advertised to an orchestrated config are dropped with a warning. Use a single-agent config (no `[orchestration]`, or `enabled = false`) to enable local tools.

Both halves of the system gate this independently — **and both must opt in for local tools to fire**, in HTTP mode and standalone mode alike. Standalone is not a special case: it uses the same handler path as `aura-web-server`, so the agent's `[agent].enable_client_tools = true` is required there too. The CLI side has a single switch (`--enable-client-tools`) that turns advertisement on or off. The server side is **per-agent** in TOML — `[agent].enable_client_tools = true` opts the single-agent config in, with an optional `client_tool_filter = ["..."]` glob list. There is no server-wide `--enable-client-tools` flag.

| Mode                                 | TOML side (`[agent].enable_client_tools`) | CLI side (`--enable-client-tools`) | Effective                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Standalone, single-agent, both on    | `true`                                    | required                           | Local tools fully enabled                                                                        |
| Standalone, single-agent, TOML off   | absent / `false`                          | (any)                              | Tools advertised but the in-process server **silently drops** them; CLI prints a startup warning |
| HTTP, single-agent, both on          | `true`                                    | required                           | Local tools fully enabled                                                                        |
| HTTP, single-agent, agent off        | absent / `false`                          | (any)                              | Tools advertised but server **silently drops** them — no local tools                             |
| Standalone or HTTP, **orchestrated** | any orchestrated config                   | (any)                              | Tools advertised but server **drops with warning** — orchestration unsupported                   |
| Both off                             | absent / `false`                          | CLI without flag                   | Pure chat                                                                                        |

Precedence for resolving the CLI flag: `--enable-client-tools` argument or `AURA_ENABLE_CLIENT_TOOLS` env var > `<project>/.aura/cli.toml` > `~/.aura/cli.toml` (`enable_client_tools = true|false`) > default (`false`). The CLI arg and env var sit at the same tier — either one will override values set in `cli.toml`.

If local tools never fire when you expect them to, check that **both** sides are opted in: the agent's TOML has `enable_client_tools = true` (and the config is single-agent), and `--enable-client-tools` is set on the CLI. In standalone mode the CLI prints a startup warning when the flag is set but no loaded config opts in.

## Permissions

AURA CLI includes a permission system that controls which local tools the model is allowed to execute. Permission rules only matter when client-side tools are enabled (see [Client-Side Tools](#client-side-tools)). Configure permissions by creating a `.aura/permissions.json` file in your project directory:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["ListFiles(*)", "Read(*)", "FindFiles(*)", "SearchFiles(*)"],
    "deny": ["Shell(*)"]
  }
}
```

- **Allow rules** — matching tools execute immediately without prompting.
- **Deny rules** — matching tools are blocked with a guidance message.
- **No match** — tools with no matching rule prompt you for approval.

The CLI walks up from the current working directory to find the closest
`.aura/permissions.json`, the same way it finds `cli.toml`. Permissions are
**project-scoped only** — there is no `~/.aura/permissions.json`. Running the
CLI from outside any project directory means no permissions are loaded, and
every local tool call prompts.

> **Renamed from `settings.json`.** Older versions read `.aura/settings.json`.
> The file is still read with a one-time deprecation warning; new "always
> allow" rules accepted at the prompt are written to `permissions.json`,
> migrating any existing rules forward.

### Available Local Tools

| Tool             | Description                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Read`           | Read file contents (supports chunked reading with offset and limit) |
| `ListFiles`      | List directory contents                                             |
| `SearchFiles`    | Search file contents with regex or literal patterns                 |
| `FindFiles`      | Find files recursively by glob pattern                              |
| `FileInfo`       | Get file or directory metadata                                      |
| `Shell`          | Execute shell commands (last resort)                                |
| `Update`         | Signal intent to modify or create files                             |
| `CompactContext` | Compact conversation history by discarding older messages           |

---

## Conversations

Conversations are automatically saved to `~/.aura/conversations/` and can be resumed:

```bash
aura --resume abc123               # from the CLI
/conversations                     # list saved conversations
/resume abc123                     # resume by ID prefix
/rename my chat                    # name the current conversation
```

---

## Logging

The CLI is silent by default — no `tracing` events are emitted unless you opt
in by pointing the CLI at a log file. When set, fmt events are written to that
path in **both REPL and one-shot mode** so stdout (and any pipe consuming it)
stays untouched.

Three places can supply the path, in precedence order:

| Source          | Form                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| CLI flag        | `--log-file /tmp/aura.log`        |
| Environment     | `AURA_LOG_FILE=/tmp/aura.log`     |
| `cli.toml`      | `log_file = "/tmp/aura.log"`      |

The file is opened in **append mode** and created if missing. The default
filter mirrors `aura-web-server`'s verbose mode (info-level for aura crates
and rig request handling); override it with `RUST_LOG` if you need different
levels.

> **Log rotation, truncation, and pruning are your responsibility.** The
> CLI appends indefinitely — it never truncates, rotates, or compresses the
> file. Use `logrotate`, a cron job, `truncate -s 0`, or a shell wrapper to
> keep the file from growing unbounded.

### Standalone-mode OpenTelemetry

When running in standalone mode (the default when `--api-url` is absent), the
CLI runs the agent in-process. Set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and the CLI
will install an OpenTelemetry layer alongside (or instead of) the file fmt
layer — the same trace structure (`agent.stream` → `agent.turn` →
`mcp.tool_call`, with `orchestration.*` between them in orchestration mode)
that `aura-web-server` exports. The CLI mirrors the server's
`.instrument(info_span!("agent.stream"))` wrapper around `execute_completion`
in `crates/aura-cli/src/backend/direct.rs`, so input/output attributes,
token counts, and tool spans all land in the right place.

The CLI omits the `chat_completions` / `streaming_completion` infrastructure
spans because there is no HTTP layer in standalone mode — those live on a
separate trace in the server. HTTP-mode CLIs skip OTel entirely: your
traces come from the server process.

OTel init is independent of `--log-file`; you can run with traces only
(no log file), logs only (no OTel endpoint), or both. The CLI builds a
single tokio runtime in `main` and threads it into `Backend::from_config`,
`run_oneshot`, and `run_repl` — `logging::init` runs inside that runtime's
context so the OTLP gRPC exporter can grab `Handle::current()` during
construction, and the `BatchSpanProcessor` worker lives on the same
runtime that drives the request loop. `main` flushes via
`aura::logging::shutdown_tracer()` before the runtime drops so trailing
spans aren't lost.

Two wire protocols are supported, selected by `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`:
`grpc` (the default) and `http/protobuf`.
With HTTP `/v1/traces` is appended to `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`.
(Use `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` if you need an explicit path).

Other relevant OTel env vars (read by the `aura` crate, unchanged from the
server):

| Variable                                | Purpose                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`           | OTLP collector endpoint. When unset, no OTel layer is installed even in standalone mode.             |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`    | Traces-specific endpoint; takes precedence over the generic one.                                     |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`           | `grpc` (default) or `http/protobuf`. `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_PROTOCOL` takes precedence.          |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`            | Comma-separated `key=value` pairs sent as gRPC metadata / HTTP headers (e.g. proxy auth).            |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`                     | Resource attribute (defaults to `aura`).                                                             |
| `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL`                        | Override the OTel layer's filter. Default captures `aura=trace`, `aura_cli=info`, and rig spans.     |
| `OTEL_RECORD_CONTENT`                   | When `true`, prompt/completion/tool args/results are recorded as span attributes.                    |
| `OTEL_CONTENT_MAX_LENGTH`               | Max bytes for content attributes (default 1000, rounded down to UTF-8 boundary).                     |

---

## SSE Stream Panel

Toggle with `/stream` to see raw SSE events in real time. Supported event types:

- `aura.tool_requested` / `aura.tool_start` / `aura.tool_complete`
- `aura.usage` / `aura.tool_usage`
- `aura.progress` / `aura.session_info` / `aura.reasoning`
- `aura.orchestrator.*` — multi-agent orchestration events

Events are shared types from the `aura-events` crate, ensuring identical parsing between HTTP and standalone modes.

---

## Compatibility

AURA CLI speaks the standard [OpenAI Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) and works with any compatible backend:

- AURA by Mezmo
- OpenAI API / Azure OpenAI
- Local models via Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, etc.
- Any service implementing `/v1/chat/completions`

### Hybrid Tool Execution

When client-side tools are enabled, both backends execute server-side tools (MCP, RAG) within the agent's stream and pause for client-side tools (Shell, Read, ...) to be executed in the REPL with permission checks. The CLI follows up with a `role: "tool"` result and the agent resumes. Server-side tool results arrive via `aura.tool_complete` SSE events; the CLI uses those rather than executing locally.

When `--enable-client-tools` is off, the CLI only sees server-side tool execution. See [Client-Side Tools](#client-side-tools) for the full flow.
